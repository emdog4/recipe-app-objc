# recipe-app-objc

This is a sample app I wrote when I was learning Autolayout. There are no xibs or storyboard and all layout is done with autolayout programmatically. the project has a suprising number of classes and uses lots of features of UIKit. It's a good example for split-view controllers, core data, tableview cells with autolayout, tab bar controller, and alot more. I hate to throw this away, so I hope it's useful for someone.
